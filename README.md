##
<!-- Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.  -->

## What I have learned
  - use of built-in module random
  - how to choose a random word from list of words
  - use of input() function
  - use of if - else to validate user input
  - use of lists and sets

## Functions I used
  - def check_guess(guess) - Function to check whether the guessed character is in the random word.
    
  - def ask_for_input(): - Function to take an input and validate it as follows.
    - Whether is alphabetic character
    - Whether the length of the input is 1
    - call check_guess() function.
   
## Usage instruction

1. Run Milestone_5.py programme to open the Hangman game app.
2. Enter the first letter (guess) you want to check using your keyboard.
3. If you enter character 5 times wrong, you will loose the game.
4. If guess and enter correct character each time, you will win.
5. You can enter any particular letter only once.
6. If there are duplicate letters in the word, you need to enter that letter only once.

## Installation process
In this project, we use GitHub to track changes to our code and save them online in a GitHub repo. 

and maybe a table of contents.
